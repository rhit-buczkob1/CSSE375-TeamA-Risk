**Guide**

**Setup**
The game is divided into an initial setup phase, and then a main phase. When you start the game, the setup phase will begin with 4 players. Each player can click an unclaimed territory, and select "add Army". This will claim the territory, and then the next player's setup will automatically begin.

**Main game**

The game is divided into a couple of main phases. After the setup phase, at the start of the player's turn, is the assignment phase. During this phase, a player will be autoassigned armies based on their controlled territories and continents. During this phase, click on any territory you own and click "add army" to add an army to that territory. You can also play cards in order to gain more armies. If you have 5 or 6 cards, you MUST play some cards. To play cards, select three cards, either all with the same troop type, or with two of the same troop types and a wildcard. To do this, you can select your cards from the dropdown menu's adjacent to the "Spend Cards" button. Once you wish to spend them, click the "Spend Cards" button.

Once you have placed all your armies and spent cards if you had to spend them, clicking the "Next Phase" button will advance you to the attack phase. To Attack during the attack phase, have the defender and the attacker set their dice with the two sliders at the bottom of the screen. Then select the territory you wish to attack from, press "Attack" and then click the territory you want to attack, and press "Attack" again. 

Once you are finished attacking players, you may advance to the "fortification phase" by clicking the "Next Phase" button. During the fortify phase you can move armies from one and only one territory to an adjacent territory, provided you own both territories. To do this, click the territory you want to move an army from, then press "Add Army" then click the territory you want to move an army to, then press "Add Army" again, and an army will move.


**Winning or losing** 
If you run out of territories, then your player number will no longer show up after "Next Phase" is selected. If you are the last player alive, you will get a "You Win" screen.

**Miscellaneous**
If you press the "Change Language", you can select to change the language from any currently supported language at any time

To exit the game, feel free to just click the "x" button on the top right, note that Saving/Loading is not yet implemented.
